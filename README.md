## About

This action collects all git commit messages between two git tags and provides
them for further usage.

It uses the repository in the current working directory and fetches all tags
from the origin remote.

A regex pattern `tag-pattern` can be defined to filter tags. Matching tags will
be sorted and the latest two tags are taken for comparison.

The action will fail if no matching tags are found.

If only one matching tag is found, the changes from the initial commit to this
tag will be collected.

The action is meant to be run on a
[`push:tags`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#running-your-workflow-only-when-a-push-of-specific-tags-occurs)
event.
